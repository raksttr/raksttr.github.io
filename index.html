        <h2>Lets make a change!</h2>
        <p>Poverty is a pervasive widespread condition that acts as a profound barrier to human flourishing, it viciously leaves its victims of people and families in multi-genrational economic, social, and educational disadvantedges. To overcome poverty we need a new mindset, acquire new skills, and adopting strict financial discipline. Key strategies include increasing financial literacy, setting long-term financial goals, boosting income through education or training, reducing expenses, and surrounding oneself with positive, growth-oriented individuals. It is a process that often requires sacrificing immediate comfort for future stability.   .</p>

    <h2>Common Questions</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>What is poverty?</summary>
      <p>Poverty is the state of lacking the financial resources and essential items needed to maintain a basic standard of living, including food, clean water, shelter, and clothing. Statistically, children under age 5, female-headed households, and racial minorities—specifically Native American, Black, and Hispanic communities—are affected the most by poverty in the U.S.. Children have the highest poverty rate of any age group, while Southern regions experience the highest rates of poverty.</p>

      <summary>How can we help?</summary>
      <p>Thanks to this years Codeathon theme we are able to bring awarenees to poverty in todays society. My team and I hope this will spark ideas in others to contribute what they can to this cause. We hope to influence more sites like Johanna's free online pantry. Brookelynns game should regulate well with our government to be more attentive to this issue and have direct leadership to take initiative in helping communities in need
